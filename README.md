# Projects and Technical Work

## Food Security Research
- [Mapping Hunger in the Concrete Jungle: Exploring Food Deserts, Food Swamps, and Demographic Disparities in New York City](Mapping%20Hunger%20in%20the%20Concrete%20Jungle_%20Exploring%20Food%20Deserts,%20Food%20Swamps,%20and%20Demographic%20Disparities%20in%20New%20York%20City%20(5).pdf)
  - A spatial analysis of food access inequities in New York City using QGIS for geospatial visualization, R for statistical analysis, GeoDa for spatial statistics, and Python for data processing
  - Currently expanding this research as part of my master's thesis, further investigating the relationship between food environment and demographic patterns in urban landscapes
  - Methods include spatial autocorrelation analysis, demographic clustering, and advanced GIS mapping techniques

## Healthcare Data Science Research 
- [Understanding Trans Lives in America: A Focus on Trans Youth Healthcare][Understanding Trans Lives in America: A Focus on Trans Youth Healthcare](Understanding%20Trans%20Lives%20in%20America_%20A%20Focus%20on%20Trans%20Youth%20Healthcare%20(9).pdf)
 - Conducted comprehensive public health data analysis using Tableau to create interactive visualizations of transgender healthcare access patterns across the United States
 - Performed extensive data cleaning and integration of multiple datasets, including state-level policy data, demographic information, and healthcare statistics
 - Created advanced data visualizations including geospatial mapping of trans youth populations, policy restriction analysis, and trend analysis of healthcare procedures
 - Applied statistical analysis techniques to understand the intersection of racial demographics, insurance coverage, and healthcare access
 - Currently expanding this research as part of my master's thesis, further investigating healthcare disparities using advanced data science methodologies and GIS techniques

## Neural Network Dependency Parser
Natural language parsing implementation using neural networks in Python.
